# francinette-docker
Docker image for use [francinette](https://github.com/xicodomingues/francinette).
https://hub.docker.com/r/liqsuq/francinette

## Usage
```
$ docker run -it --rm -v {SOURCE PATH}:/src liqsuq/francinette [FRANCINETTE OPTS ...]
```

## Restrictions
- Not all testers have been checked. Perhaps It will missing a package. The checks will come with my learning progress.

- The test to run ft\_lstmap() in libft-war-machine shows “comp. failed” on the screen. This is regardless of whether or not ft\_lstmap() can compile, and even if it does, the test succeeds.

## Thanks
To [xicodomingues](https://github.com/xicodomingues) for [francinette](https://github.com/xicodomingues/francinette)
